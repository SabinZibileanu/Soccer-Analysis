# Soccer-Analysis
A data analysis project that I have done throughout a 1-month Data Camp organized by the Romanian Football Federation.

It is focused on pre-match opponent analysis reports centered around defensive play.

All the data was provided by the WyScout platform.

How to run the project:

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SabinZibileanu/Soccer-Analysis.git
   cd Soccer-Analysis

2. Go into the dashboarding file
   ```bash
   cd dashboarding

3. Install the necessary requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
